# Building an Antenna Matching Network with Zener

We need to build three components for our network: Antenna CRC Matcher, Common Mode Choke, T-Filter. If we pull it off with Zener, it should end up looking like the three KiCad schematics below!

Let's start with the Antenna CRC Matcher (ACRCM). The first thing we should start out with is importing our dependencies. Diode, very kindly, provides a few generics in the [standard library](https://github.com/diodeinc/stdlib/tree/main/generics) that are super helpful for each of our components. Notably, our ACRCM makes use of an SMA connector, resistor, capacitor, inductor, ground and antenna schematic symbol. We can easily import each of these schematics using the built in `Module()` or `load()` function coupled with the default package aliases if module is already covered within the standard library.

```zener
# AntennaCRCMatcher.zen
load("@stdlib/interfaces.zen", "Ground")

Resistor = Module("@stdlib/generics/Resistor.zen")
Capacitor = Module("@stdlib/generics/Capacitor.zen")
Inductor = Module("@stdlib/generics/Inductor.zen")
```

However, with both our SMA connector and the antenna, the standard library does not provide a module, so we will need to create a module for each component ourself.

## What Does Zener Consider a Module?
If you check the [Zener module specification](https://docs.pcb.new/pages/spec#files-as-modules) you'll see the following:

>Each `.zen` file is a Starlark module. It can be used in two ways:
>
> 1. Its exported symbols can be `load()`ed into other modules. For example, `load("./MyFile.zen", "MyFunction", "MyType")` will load the `MyFunction` and `MyType` symbols from the `MyFile.zen` module.
> 
> 2. It can be loaded as a schematic module using the `Module()` helper. For example, `MyFile = Module("./MyFile.zen")` will import `MyFile.zen` as a schematic module, which you can instantiate like so:
> 
```zener
MyFile = Module("./MyFile.zen")
MyFile(
    name = "MyFile",
    ...
)
```

In short, **a module is defined by a `.zen` file that declares its inputs and creates components** So, let's define a module for our SMA connector and antenna with this knowledge. 

I'll first make a `MyModules` directory, where we can put both of our custom modules. Starting with our `SMAConnector.zen` file, let's start with getting our schematic symbol from KiCad. If we double click on the schematic symbol in KiCad, at the bottom left we can see a `Library link: Connector:Conn_Coaxial_Small`. Then, we can [import the symbol with Zener](https://docs.pcb.new/pages/spec#symbol) as follows (notice how we append `.kicad_sym`):

```zener
SMA_symbol = Symbol("@kicad-symbols/Connector.kicad_sym:Conn_Coaxial_Small")
```

Now, if we think logically about a connector, we need one input and one output. What better construct than an `io()` declaration! Let's define our two `io()`s for the connector, which are `input` and `external` with [a type of net](https://docs.pcb.new/pages/spec#net):

```zener
# Declare inputs
input = io("input", Net)
external = io("external", Net)
```

Finally, we'll define a component for our SMA Connector. A component requires a name, footprint, symbol, and pins (which are defined by the symbol):

```zener
Component(
    name = "SMA_Connector",
    footprint = "KICAD",
    symbol = SMA_Symbol,
    pins = {
        "In": input,
        "Ext": external
    }
)
```
> [!TIP]
> Hovering over the pins in a component definition will tell you all the pins Zener expects you to define.

> [!NOTE] 
> There are other defineable fields in the component, [check out the spec](https://docs.pcb.new/pages/spec#component)!

Let's quickly take a look at the whole file before we move on.

```zener
SMA_Symbol = Symbol("@kicad-symbols/Connector.kicad_sym:Conn_Coaxial_Small")

input = io("input", Net)
external = io("external", Net)

Component(
    name = "SMA_Connector",
    footprint = "KICAD",
    symbol = SMA_Symbol,
    pins = {
        "In": input,
        "Ext": external
    }
)
```
And the generated output, when clicking on the `pcb: View Schematic` button in VSCode:

Pretty close! One small personal preference is inline defining the symbol for our component. We might also want to change the prefix from U1 to J1, when we initialize the component. We can improve our `SMAConnector.zen` file by adding a prefix field to the `Component()` function and using a `config`. We should also include an actual footprint, so we can render the finalized PCB. There are two ways to do this. We can go digging in the cache at `~/Library/Caches/pcb/gitlab/kicad/libraries/kicad-footprints/...`. Then you need to find the KiCad version and folder where the footprints are. Alternatively, you can just use `pcb pro search` to search for a component and automatically look through the footprints until it finds one that makes sense. We're going to use the first way for demonstration.

```zener
load("@stdlib/interfaces.zen", "Ground")

input = io("input", Net)
external = io("external", Net)

prefix = config("prefix", str, default="J")

Component(
    name = "SMA_Connector",
    footprint = File("@kicad-footprints/Connector_Coaxial.pretty/SMA_Amphenol_132134_Vertical.kicad_mod"),
    symbol = Symbol("@kicad-symbols/Connector.kicad_sym:Conn_Coaxial_Small"),
    prefix = prefix,
    pins = {
        "In": input,
        "Ext": external
    }
)

add_property("layout_path", "build/preview")
```

![](../images/Second_Pass.png)

Even better!

Similarly for the antenna:

```zener
output = io("output", Net)

prefix = config("prefix", str, default="AE")

Component(
    name = "Antenna",
    footprint = File("@kicad-footprints/RF_Antenna.pretty/Astrocast_AST50127-00.kicad_mod"),
    prefix = prefix,
    symbol = Symbol("@kicad-symbols/Device.kicad_sym:Antenna"),
    pins = {
        "A": output,
    }
)
```
![](../images/antenna.png)

## Antenna CRC Matcher
Let's first import our custom modules into our `AntennaCRCMatcher.zen`:

```zener
Antenna = Module("../MyModules/Antenna.zen")
SMA_Connector = Module("../MyModules/SMAConnector.zen")
```

We should also define our `Net()`s and and `io()`s. If a wire or signal is internal, we should define it as a `Net`, but if we expect it be attached to another wire or signal that's external to the module, we should use `io()`. I've added annotations to our original schematic from KiCad:
![](../images/Named_Nets.png)

Let's now make it in Zener!

```zener
input = io("input", Net, default = Net("input"))
output = io("output", Net, default = Net("output"))
gnd = io("gnd", Ground, default = Ground("gnd"))
inductor_in = Net("inductor_in")
t_junction = Net("t_junction")
```

Finally, we need to hook up the pins of every component, and we'll use placeholder values for the package and value:

```zener
Antenna(name = "Antenna", output = t_junction)
SMA_Connector(name = "SMA_Connector", input = input, external = gnd.NET)
Inductor(name = "L1", value = "10nH", package = "0603", P1 = input, P2 = t_junction)
Capacitor(name = "C1", value = "10pF", package = "0603", P1 = t_junction, P2 = gnd.NET)
```

... and that's it! You may have to move around components to make it look pretty (and the coordinates will be saved at the bottom of the file as location hints for the schematic viewer), but you've created a functional schematic with Zener!
